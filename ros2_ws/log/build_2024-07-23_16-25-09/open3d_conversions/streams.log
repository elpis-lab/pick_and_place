[0.071s]   The OLD behavior for policy CMP0072 will be removed from a future version

[0.071s] 
[0.071s]   The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
[0.071s]   policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
[0.071s]   specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
[0.071s]   behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
